# Florida Real Estate

### The Business Challenge
Floridaâ€™s residential real estate market has seen a influx of interest since COVID, but given the number of available listings, it can be difficult for a potential homebuyer to narrow down their search.
- A potential buyer might have multiple parameters that are a constraint but not know where to start
- It is not easy to compare larger areas (i.e. entire zip codes, towns, etc.) with one another on sites such as Zillow or Redfin
- Geographically difficult to visualize to narrow down zip codes
